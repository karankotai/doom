# Components directory
#
# Responsibilities:
# - Reusable UI components
# - Organized by feature or atomic design (atoms, molecules, organisms)
#
# Suggested structure:
# - ui/          - Generic UI components (Button, Input, Modal)
# - layout/      - Layout components (Header, Sidebar, Footer)
# - features/    - Feature-specific components (JourneyCard, AppletRenderer)
#
# Each component should be in its own directory with:
# - ComponentName.tsx    - Component implementation
# - ComponentName.test.tsx - Tests (optional)
# - index.ts             - Re-export
